Log&Roll SDK
=======

Use the official Log&Roll SDK for iOS to push logs from your iOS app to the Log&Roll network.

##Installation from source

***Note:*** This will set you up with the latest experimental version of Log&Roll. If you want to use a stable version, please download the SDK from your app's installation page.

- Sign up on [Log&Roll](http://logroll.in) if you haven't done already
- Select or Register your application
	
	Optionally, add team members to your app so they can view logs too
			
	
- Go to installation, choose 'iOS' as platform and grab the example code for your application and follow the instructions from there.

  ***Instead of downloading the SDK from the installation page,*** make sure you clone this repository and add the `LogAndRoll-SDK` folder in the `LogAndRoll-SDK/LogAndRoll-SDK/Libraries/` folder
